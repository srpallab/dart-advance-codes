* Abstract Class
  - keyword ~extends~ can inherit One Class
  - keyword ~with~ can inherit Multiple Class
  - We can add logic to abstract method. But it no longer remain
    abstract method. 
  - ~@mustCallSuper~ use to make ~super~ mandatory.
  - Abstract classes can have constructors.
  - If abstract classes have constructors, sub classes have to
    implement or call that constructors.
  - Abstract classes as ~mixins~: When abstract classes don't have
    constructors, they can be mixed into existing classes. Then we use
    ~with~ keyword.
* ~Mixins~
  - ~Mixins~ are abstract classes that can't have constructors.
  - They can have abstract or implemented methods
  - Constrains on ~mixins~: This allow you to limit who the ~mixin~
    can be used on.
* Isolate
  - Isolate are non-shared-memory threads of code that can run in
    parallel.
  - They are like threads or processes
  - Each isolate has its own memory pool and a single thread that has
    an event loop.
  - The event loop of an isolate is simple
    - ~start -> loop -> end~
  - Hogging the event-loop of the main isolate might cause jerkiness.
  - The main isolate is reserved for the ~UI~ of your app.
  - Heavy tasks should be offloaded to a background worker.
  - It also called worker isolate.
  - Every isolate, upon finishing it's work, can send an object back
    to its owner.
  - compute() function available for Flutter developer but not on web.
  - compute() function wraps itself around an isolate.
  - Message passing between isolates can be heavy because it involves
    coping memory contents.
  - using Isolate exit the memory is assigned to the receiving isolate
    and it's complexity is O(1).
  - ~Isolate.spawn()~ the new isolate will become part of the caller
    isolate group.
  - ~Isolate.exit()~ works only if the isolates are in the same
    group.
